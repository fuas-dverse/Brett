## Context
This document will contain a weekly reflection to look back at my week. Every week on Thursday or Friday, I will write a small summary of the week. This can be different each week, and for this I will add a grade to each week from 1 to 10. This way I can check for some patterns.

## Week 1
Start of a new semester, really exited about the project I have chosen. Also nice to meet the group and great to see that we all have our own specialization. Some did cyber security, some have a more experience with AI and some with the frontend. Even thought the scope of the project is not clear completely, I think this can come in handy. I could not be there with the HackIT presentation on Thursday, but the preparation went well. 

**Grade:** 8 - Liked to get to know the group and the project

## Week 2
This week I did get more context about the group project. This was needed because I did not know the end goal from this point. In the end, there is no end goal for now. Marc says it is just a mountain me and the group has to discover. Without knowing what is on the top of the mountain. 

I think this is a good thing, because it keeps me motivated. This week was also the start of sprint 0.

**Grade:** 8 - Motivation is high because of the big challenge

## Week 3
This week was already the end of sprint 0, it was more or less exploring what the project will be. After lots of conversations with Marc, me and the group are understanding the project better. In Thursday we had our first sprint delivery, for our group was more about talking about the individual exploration. 

I think this sprint was needed for all of us, but looking forward to the next sprint where we are going to have a specific goal. This goal is going to be: "Create a minimal platform where our individual bots / agents can run in".

After the sprint delivery, I organized a retrospective in order to look back at the first sprint. We did it using the 4 L's (I used it in my internship). The 4 L's are standing for: Liked, Learned, Lacked and Longed for. I think this retrospective went really well.

**Grade:** 7 - Happy with our exploration and with the communication in the group

## Week 4
This week was the beginning of sprint 1, we started the sprint with Reno and I planning our sprint for the individual project. We looked into our own scenario to implement this in the platform. On the end of the week, we also created our Research Plan. 

For the group project, I said to the group, I think we need to have a scrum master each sprint from now on. I think it is very helpful for taking leadership in a group. Sprint 1, I chose to be the Scrum master. This means I have to plan in the meetings with the group, and I will lead the retrospective on the end of this sprint.

**Grade:** 8 - Good group progress

## Week 5
For me this week was a good week in getting to know about ActivityPub, I already read about it before. But this week I made a first version up and running. Understanding it a bit better now, but I still has a long way to go. 

I also have Dockerized my own agents to make 2 bots talk to me based on a certain question. They are both running in a Docker container using flask, so they can be accessed via a URL.

**Grade:** 9 - Finally did some more programming

## Week 6
End of the first official sprint, I think I made lots of progress in getting to know the project. I did some research in documenting about ActivitPub and Kubernetes. The ActivityPub was more code based, because a group member (Reno) made a good research that I have read. 

In the beginning of the week, we as a group give each of us a task to realize the prototype based on the goal. Each of us got their own task, on Tuesday everything was combined together to make our prototype ready for the demo on Thursday.

Also started working on my first portfolio, but from my opinion, I think in the future we needed to have the presentation about the portfolio a bit earlier. Because officially we are free at Friday and we got the presentation about the portfolio on Thursday.

**Grade:** 8 - Happy with the result of the goal / prototype from this sprint
