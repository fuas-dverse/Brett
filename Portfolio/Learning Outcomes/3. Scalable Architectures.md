## Description
Besides functionality, you develop architecture of an enterprise software based on explicitly stated software quality requirements. You explicitly focus on quality requirements most relevant to your projectsâ€™ contexts. Quality requirements dictated by law (eg.GDPR) and ethics (eg. security) must always be addressed. You design your system with future adaptation in mind. You assess the extent in which the quality requirements are met by your software implementation.

## Possible ways to achieve?
1. **Identify Quality Requirements:** Document essential legal (like GDPR) and ethical (security) requirements. Prioritize based on project needs.
2. **Design with Scalability and Compliance:** Ensure architecture meets functionality, scalability, security, and compliance from the start, facilitating future growth.
3. **Implement and Check Compliance:** Execute the design focusing on key quality requirements and regularly verify compliance with legal and ethical standards.
4. **Assess and Adapt:** Continuously evaluate software against quality requirements using tests and audits, and adjust architecture as needed for alignment and improvement.
