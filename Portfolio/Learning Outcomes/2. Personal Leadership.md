## Evidence

**Weekly Reflection:** For self reflection and being critical about myself, I keep track of a weekly reflection. In here I will discuss my week, how it went, from code to communicating and collaborating with the others. 

I also give each week its own grade from 1 to 10, when I find some sort of patterns in a good or bad way, I can look into those weeks and change or leave it for the next weeks. This can improve my personal capabilities.
