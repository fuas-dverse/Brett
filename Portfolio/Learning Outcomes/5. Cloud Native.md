## Description
You develop your software according to the best practices of cloud native development. You deploy (parts of) your application to a cloud platform. You integrate cloud services (for example: Serverless computing, cloud storage, container management) into your software, and can explain the added value of these cloud services for your software quality.

## Possible ways to achieve?
1. **Embrace Cloud Native Principles:** Apply principles like microservices, immutable infrastructure, and embrace a DevOps culture for CI/CD.
2. **Integrate Cloud Services:** Use services like serverless computing, cloud storage, and Kubernetes to enhance application scalability and management.
3. **Strategize Deployment:** Develop a cloud-based deployment strategy using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for efficient resource management.
4. **Evaluate Quality and Explain Value:** Assess and articulate how cloud services improve your softwareâ€™s quality, focusing on scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.
