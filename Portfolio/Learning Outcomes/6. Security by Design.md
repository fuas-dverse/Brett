## Description
You investigate how to minimize security risks for your application, and you incorporate best practices in your whole software development process.

## Possible ways to achieve?
1. **Assess Security Risks:** Conduct a security risk assessment to identify vulnerabilities and threats using tools like threat modeling.
2. **Apply Security Practices:** Embed security best practices throughout the development process, including secure coding, encryption, and regular code reviews.
3. **Automate Security Checks:** Use tools for automated security testing like SAST and DAST to find vulnerabilities early and often.
4. **Monitor and Respond:** Implement continuous monitoring for real-time threat detection and have an incident response plan ready for quick action.
