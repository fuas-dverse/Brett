## About myself üßë
My name is Brett Mulder, 21 years young. My hobbies are going to the Gym and working on hobby projects as a software developer. Beside school, I am already working at Beech, this was my internship company from last semester. I think I can learn lot more when working alongside school.

In the weekends I am frequently with my friends and going out. On other spare time I am with my girlfriend. Beside all my hobbies I like cooking (only pasta's üçù). 

## Projects overview 
For understanding this reading guide better, it is good to first get a better understanding on what project I will be creating this semester. First I will tell a bit about the group project, as the context of this will be important for the individual as they are closely linked together.

### Group project ü§ù
The group project I selected is called ‚ÄúCollaborating Bots‚Äù the goal of this project is to create a decentralized piece of software where multiple individual agents can work together to specific goal prompted by a user. For example: ‚ÄúI want to book a hotel in Spain close to Torrente de Pareis, that has at least an average of three-star reviews and has to be the cheapest one.‚Äù To achieve this task there will be multiple steps involved like searching for hotels near the place, checking the prices, checking the reviews and booking. All these tasks will be an individual agent that works together with the rest to achieve the goal.

### Individual project üßë
So, why I stated that the group project and individual one are closely linked together is because my individual project is to create one or more of these agents that can work together in the group project's network. Which I'm doing together with Brett.

Initially, we wanted to create some kind of system where users can book tickets to an event, we wanted to do this because we thought that it would fit nicely with the scalable architectures learning outcome. When we give a pitch about this idea to our teachers, they said it would be way too big to combined with the work required for the group project. That is why we decided to scale down this project to a couple of agents that can execute the scenario of helping users find tickets to an upcoming festival.

To clarify this a bit more, we decided to create a couple of bots revolving to this scenario.
1. An agent that gives users information about upcoming festivals
2. An agent that gives users ticket links of festivals (Google agent)
3. An agent that can add a 'booked' festival into a user's Google calendar

If and when the time allows it, we might create more agents for this or another¬†scenario.

## Self Assessment ‚úÖ
In this part I am going to be give myself a assessment based on the Learning Outcomes.

## Reflection
I think this first 6 weeks went really well in communicating with the group and exploring the project. Based on the code, there could have been more, but the project context was not clear for the first 2/3 weeks. But still it were good 6 weeks. 

For the next portfolio, I would like to have touched every Learning Outcome, and maybe some on beginning / proficient. For the next weeks I want to focus more on the Technical Learning Outcomes. I think the 2 Professional Learning Outcomes will be touched by itself during the semester. This because of the group communication and collaboration.

## Learning Outcomes Evidence
#### 1. Professional Standards
###### Individual
- **Evidence:** Research Plan (before workshop) - Individual
- **Scope:** Individual
- **Argument:** Reno and I are doing the individual project together. Therefore, in the third week we had already created a research plan, not knowing there was going to be a workshop for this part.  
---
- **Evidence:** Design Oriented Research Plan - Individual
- **Scope:** Individual
- **Argument:** This is the updated file for the research plan, but now context based. In here we have created a cleared view about what the research questions are going to be. We used the methods that were explained in the workshop. So we first created a main question using the parameters, after that we added the sub questions based on the parameters. And at last, we applied the DOT framework for the strategies and the methods.
---
- **Evidence:** Individual Project Pitch
- **Scope:** Individual
- **Argument:** In week 2 I did a project pitch for the festival planner. It was done with a small presentation. I had to keep it short in order to go not too much into detail. 
---
- **Evidence:** Individual project: Sprint 1 Delivery
- **Scope:** Individual
- **Argument:** For the first sprint delivery, we created a presentation for the individual project. In here are the achieved goals and next goals for next sprint. The backlog is implemented (we updated it more for the next sprint). For now, we only did "Bob the builder" researched to gain knowledge. But next sprint will be more focused on the DOT framework questions.
###### Group
- **Evidence:** Video prototype 1 
- **Scope:** Group
- **Argument:** This is the video that shows the working prototype from the demo in sprint 1. It is a minimal platform that has 3 individual agents working together to help a festival goer with booking a festival.
---
- **Evidence:** Sprint 0 delivery
- **Scope:** Group
- **Argument:** This contains the presentation from sprint 0. It follows the guidelines from canvas.
---
- **Evidence:** Sprint 1 delivery
- **Scope:** Group
- **Argument:** This contains the presentation from sprint 1. It follows the guidelines from canvas.
---
- **Evidence:** Project plan
- **Scope:** Group
- **Argument:** This is the project plan, because our project was not very clear in the beginning. Some parts in the project can be different from the knowledge we have now. But is was a good start to understand the project a bit better.
---
- **Evidence:** Design oriented research plan
- **Scope:** Group
- **Argument:** For the research questions we used the context based methods from the workshop to setup good and logic research questions for the group project. 

#### 2. Personal Leadership
###### Individual
- **Evidence:** GitHub Board Individual
- **Scope:** Individual
- **Argument:** For the individual tasks we keep our tasks in one place, that place is the GitHub project board. It has the following fields: Backlog, To-Do, Doing, Review and closed. This way I can check which tasks I can do and what has already been done.

- **Evidence:** Feedpulse Marc 19-3-2024
- **Scope:** Individual
- **Argument:** ...

- **Evidence:** Feedpulse Tulin 28-03-2024
- **Scope:** Individual
- **Argument:** ...
---
- **Evidence:** Weekly Personal Reflection
- **Scope:** Individual
- **Argument:** Every Friday after a school week, I look back at the week. This way I can reflect on myself. I am doing this with a small description about the week. Look what has gone great, and look what went not so well. And on the and I rate my week with a number from 1 to 10. This way I get an overview about how the weeks are going in one quick scan.

###### Group
- **Evidence:** Feedpulse Tulin 07-03-2024
- **Scope:** Group
- **Argument:** ...
---
- **Evidence:** Sprint 0 Retrospective
- **Scope:** Group
- **Argument:** The first 2 sprints, I was the scrum master, because there are 5 sprints (6 when implementing sprint 0). So sprint 0 and 1 I was the scrum master. Here I introduced this way of doing a retrospective. I use the 4 L's, it stands for Liked, Learned, Lacked and Longed for. Everyone gets 5 till 10 minutes to fill in the board with keywords. After that we are going to discuss it, and when needed, write action points to the board. This evidence was the retro for sprint 0.

- **Evidence:** Sprint 1 Retrospective
- **Scope:** Group
- **Argument:** The first 2 sprints, I was the scrum master, because there are 5 sprints (6 when implementing sprint 0). So sprint 0 and 1 I was the scrum master. Here I introduced this way of doing a retrospective. I use the 4 L's, it stands for Liked, Learned, Lacked and Longed for. Everyone gets 5 till 10 minutes to fill in the board with keywords. After that we are going to discuss it, and when needed, write action points to the board. This evidence was the retro for sprint 1.
---
- **Evidence:** GitHub board Group
- **Scope:** Group
- **Argument:** For the group project, we also use GitHub. But now instead of all the individual project. We have a general board for the group project.

#### 3. Scalable Architectures
###### Individual
- **Evidence:** Research Kubernetes
- **Scope:** Individual
- **Argument:** For this sprint, Kubernetes is a part to achieve the Scalable Architecture LO. Even thought this is a "Bob the builder" research, I gained knowledge about Kubernetes. I look into the technical details, keywords, how to implement and more. 

###### Group
- **Evidence:** Flow diagram idea
- **Scope:** Group
- **Argument:** In one of the first weeks, we have created a flow diagram about how ActivityPub could work out in our project. As you can see there is a user, and then the flow when using ActivityPub.
---
- **Evidence:** Flow Diagram idea 2 - Sketch
- **Scope:** Group
- **Argument:** Eventually we build on top of that, to check how we could implement Machine Learning and Message queues together into the project.

#### 4. Development and Operations (DevOps)
###### Individual
- **Evidence:** Dockerized Agents
- **Scope:** Individual
- **Argument:** In connection with the group project, I wanted to take a look in how bots can communicate with each other in a Docker environment. For this example, I have 2 agents running in docker as s Flask Python application. Then I have another 2 docker containers running, a MongoDB database and MongoUI. Those containers are all connected to each other to make a main.py work for choosing a certain agent.

###### Group
- **Evidence:** Docker prototype 1
- **Scope:** Group
- **Argument:** For the prototype there are 3 of our individual agents running in 1 single docker environment (as you can see in the picture). The docker containers are all in the same network so they can all see / find each other.

#### 5. Cloud Native
###### Individual
- **Evidence:** MongoDB Cloud
- **Scope:** Individual
- **Argument:** For the Reno and I created Festival Information Agents, there is a MongoDB Cloud database setup to use Vector Search.
###### Group
Nothing to prove yet...

#### 6. Security by Design
###### Individual
Nothing to prove yet...
###### Group
Nothing to prove yet...

#### 7. Distributed Data
###### Individual
- **Evidence:** Research databases
- **Scope:** Individual
- **Argument:** As an individual I created research about what databases are good for the group project. So I checked which types of database there are. But also what options of different databases. This is also a "Bob the builder" research, so there is no concrete conslusion.  
###### Group
Nothing to prove yet...

## Conclusion üí¨
Overall, the first portfolio is good. I think I touched lot of the Learning Outcomes, but some of them are not possible in the first portfolio. I think the group is settled, I understand the group project better not. So from now on it can only get better.
