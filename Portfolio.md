## HackIT
In this section, all the brainstorm files from the first week will be here. Together with the group, we have created some ideas, discussed with the teacher. And so we got a clear view about the project. It is not defined what techniques we are going to use, except for the: ActivityPub Protocol, JSON_LD.
