## Weekly meetings
- Semester Coach: Every week on Thursday
- Workshop: Every week on Wednesday

## Portfolio
The portfolio is a very important aspect for the learning outcomes. In Canvas there are 2 important modules for this with some guidelines:
- Portfolio: https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/13669/pages/portfolio-guidelines?module_item_id=1060238
- Sprint Delivery: https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/13669/pages/sprint-delivery-guidelines?module_item_id=1060239

## Learning outcomes
- The first 2 learning outcomes for the professional skills are going to be grated by the semester coach. So be professional, keep the communication good (like when you are sick, tell the group but also the teacher of today).
- The technical learning outcomes are getting graded by Marc and Jeffrey. So this is more about the code from the individual project and the group project

## Rules
- When you cannot be at school and you gave a meeting with the semester coach or another teacher. You have to let them and your group know, this is because of your professional skills.
