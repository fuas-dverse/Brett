# Future plan

Next semester I am going to do a Minor, the minor I am going to do is called "Financial Planning". You get insights and knowledge about mortgage and the other financial parts for the future. 

I am not going to do something with IT, because the minors in the IT sector were not very interesting for me. I think I can do that in my free time as well.

After graduating I am going to travel first, I want to do this before getting a full-time job. After that, want to go work full-time in order to save some money to eventually buy a home.
