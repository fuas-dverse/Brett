# [[Peer review document]]
This contains an overview of several peer reviews I have. It can contain reviews. from me to other group members and the other way around. 

This peer review is from me to Reno. He created a research file based on the context based research using the DOT Framework. I think the structure was great and a good research. But there were some small things like images that were not showing in the markdown file. I added a comment on each line where this happened. Reno fixed it and that research was then marked as done.

This is the feedback from Reno to me. I created the UI for the DVerse application. This was a pull request in GitHub. As you can see, it has in the most cases some words spell faults. Such as Masterdon instead of Mastodon. After resolving the comments I merged it to main.

This is an approval of me to Reno his implementation of keycloak in NextJS. I think everything was great, and no unnecessary code, so I left a nice comment and merged it afterward.
